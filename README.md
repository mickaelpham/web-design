Web Design
==========

This is a simple repository to get started for web design with
a nice set of CSS tools.

### NPM

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the package manager for JavaScript,
it reads the `package.json` dependencies for your project.

### Gulp

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used to automate the workflow. It manages
assets like images and HTML files to move them around, and also connects
with the different CSS processors used in the project.

### PostCSS

[PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) is used to transform CSS with JavaScript.

### cssnext

[cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) helps using the latest CSS syntax today.
It also comes with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer),
which is nice.
